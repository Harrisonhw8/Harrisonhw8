        <h5>It was a hot summer night and in the middle of covid and I had a late night soccer game in Wyckoff for my 06 Torpedos team.  It was getting towards the end of the game and I took a shot on goal, it was deflected and then tapped in by my teamate.  While the ball was going into the goal, I was down on the ground after someone stepped on my ankle and I went down. My mom and brother were watching from the opposite side of the field. Due to covid noone could help me off the field so I had to hop to hop to my teams bench, where the parent coach took one look at my ankle and motioned for my mom to come to me.  My ankle had swelled up to a tennis ball size.  My mom was so nervous about covid she didnt want to take me to the hospital, as they were still filled with covid patients, so she called my orthopedist (who should be on speed dial at this point, prior year playing soccer I broke my wrist)(by now it was getting dark and about 8pm) and the orthopedist said if the bone wasnt protruding through the skin, it could wait until 845am the next morning, monday. At the doctor on monday, xray showed a high ankle sprain and I was placed in a boot for 6 weeks.</h5>

It took a minute but i finished the game. That night into the next morining  i could barely move my ankle. i got an x=ray and there was no break but i still had to go to the orthepedist.
